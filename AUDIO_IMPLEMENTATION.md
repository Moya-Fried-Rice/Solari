# Audio Streaming Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully implemented audio streaming functionality from Flutter to the Arduino ESP32 device. The system allows smooth transmission of audio files with progress tracking and robust error handling.

## Changes Made

### 1. Arduino Code (solari.ino)
- ✅ Added `AudioPlaybackState` struct to track incoming audio
- ✅ Enhanced `MyCharacteristicCallbacks::onWrite()` to handle:
  - `AUDIO_START` - Initialize audio reception
  - `AUDIO_DATA` - Process audio data chunks
  - `AUDIO_END` - Finalize audio reception
- ✅ Added LED indicators for audio streaming status
- ✅ Enhanced logging for audio transmission tracking

### 2. Flutter Code

#### AudioService (lib/core/services/audio_service.dart)
- ✅ Created comprehensive audio streaming service
- ✅ Supports both asset files (`waves.wav`) and generated test tones
- ✅ Implements chunked transmission with configurable delays
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking and status updates
- ✅ Adaptive MTU detection for optimal chunk sizes
- ✅ Robust error handling and recovery

#### Device Status Page (lib/screens/tabs/settings/device_status.dart)
- ✅ Added audio streaming section with two buttons:
  - "Send Waves Audio" - Sends the `waves.wav` asset file
  - "Send Test Tone" - Generates and sends a 440Hz sine wave
- ✅ Real-time progress bar during transmission
- ✅ Status text showing current operation
- ✅ Success/failure feedback via SnackBar
- ✅ Automatic UI reset after completion

## Key Features

### Smooth Transmission
- **Chunked Transfer**: Audio is sent in small chunks (180 bytes) for reliability
- **Adaptive Delays**: 25ms delay between chunks prevents overwhelming the Arduino
- **MTU Optimization**: Automatically detects and uses optimal BLE packet sizes

### User Experience
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar and status updates
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear success/failure indicators
- **Disabled State**: Buttons disabled during transmission to prevent conflicts
- **Auto-Reset**: UI automatically resets after completion

### Error Handling
- **Connection Validation**: Checks BLE connection before starting
- **Characteristic Discovery**: Automatically finds the correct BLE characteristic
- **Transmission Verification**: Tracks and reports transmission success/failure
- **Graceful Fallback**: Handles errors without crashing the app

## Technical Specifications

### Arduino Side
- **BLE Service UUID**: `4fafc201-1fb5-459e-8fcc-c5c9c331914b`
- **Characteristic UUID**: `beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26a8`
- **Commands Supported**:
  - `AUDIO_START` - Begin audio reception
  - `AUDIO_DATA<data>` - Audio data chunk
  - `AUDIO_END` - End audio reception

### Flutter Side
- **Chunk Size**: 180 bytes (optimized for BLE MTU)
- **Transmission Delay**: 25ms between chunks
- **Audio Format**: Raw PCM data (for generated tones) or WAV file data
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time progress from 0.0 to 1.0

## Usage Instructions

1. **Connect to Device**: Ensure your device is connected via BLE
2. **Navigate to Device Status**: Go to Settings → Device Status
3. **Choose Audio Type**:
   - **Waves Audio**: Click "Send Waves Audio" to transmit the `waves.wav` file
   - **Test Tone**: Click "Send Test Tone" to generate and send a 2-second 440Hz tone
4. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the progress bar and status text
5. **Check Arduino Serial**: Monitor the Arduino Serial output for detailed logs

## Arduino Serial Output Example
```
[BLE] Audio playback from Flutter started
[AUDIO] Audio chunk: 170 bytes, total: 170 bytes
[AUDIO] Audio chunk: 180 bytes, total: 350 bytes
...
[BLE] Audio playback from Flutter ended
[AUDIO] Received 24576 bytes (24.0 KB) in 2.1s (11.4 KB/s)
```

## Future Enhancements
- Add actual audio playback via I2S DAC
- Support for different audio formats
- Real-time audio streaming
- Audio volume control
- Audio effects processing

## Testing
The implementation has been designed with robust error handling and should work reliably across different devices and connection conditions. The Arduino code includes comprehensive logging to help diagnose any issues during development.
